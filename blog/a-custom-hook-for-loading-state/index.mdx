I've written a lot of React components over the past couple years that fetch or
update data with a call to a server. Not knowing how long these server calls
are going to take, I like to indicate to the user that we are working on it. I
often do this by putting the component in a loading state.

One of these components might look something like this:

```jsx
class LoadingStateExample extends React.Component {
  state = {
    loading: false
  };

  setLoading = isLoading => {
    this.setState({ loading: isLoading });
  };

  handleSubmit = () => {
    this.setLoading(true);
    makeSuccessfulApiCall().finally(() => {
      this.setLoading(false);
    });
  };

  render() {
    const { loading } = this.state;
    return (
      <div>
        {loading && <p>{"Loading..."}</p>}
        <button disable={loading} onClick={this.handleSubmit}>
          Submit
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

A bit of a micro-pattern has emerged across all of these different components.
Notice the submit handler:

```javascript
handleSubmit = () => {
  this.setLoading(true);
  makeSuccessfulApiCall().finally(() => {
    this.setLoading(false);
  });
};
```

Here is the micro-pattern in pseudo-code:

```javascript
handleSubmit = () => {
  // turn on the component's loading state

  // do a series of (potentially complex) async API interactions

  // when everything is done, turn off the loading state
};
```

It's a simple pattern that is highly effective for most API-connected
components. This is a straightforward way to give a reactive and responsive
element to our app.

With the advent of the Hooks API, we can tighten up this component a bit:

```jsx
const HooksLoadingExample = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    setLoading(true);
    makeSuccessfulApiCall().finally(() => {
      setLoading(false);
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {loading && <p>{"Loading..."}</p>}
      <button disable={loading} onClick={handleSubmit}>
        Submit
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Cool, we've used hooks. We are on the bleeding edge of modern React
development.  We've also shaved about 10 lines of code off the class component
example. This didn't have any effect on the loading state pattern -- those
lines of code still look the same.

Not just that, we still have this responsibility to manually manage the loading
state. We can shift this responsibility, or at least the individual pieces of
it, into a custom hook.

```javascript
const useLoadingWrapper = initialLoadingState => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(initialLoadingState);

  const loadingWrapper = callback => {
    setLoading(true);
    return callback().finally(() => {
      setLoading(false);
    });
  };

  return [loading, loadingWrapper];
};
```

This is bound to look familiar. It is our loading state pattern, codified as a
custom React hook. Also, it's just a function. A function we can reuse wherever
it's needed so that we aren't reinventing the loading state wheel over and over
across our app.

Here is how we can use the `useLoadingWrapper` hook:

```jsx
const LoadingWrapperExample = () => {
  const [loading, loadingWrapper] = useLoadingWrapper(false);

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    loadingWrapper(makeSuccessfulApiCall);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {loading && <p>{"Loading..."}</p>}
      <button disable={loading} onClick={handleSubmit}>
        Submit
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The above `handleSubmit` function is a bit over-simplified. A more realisitic
example might look something like this:

```javascript
const handleSubmit = () => {
  loadingWrapper(() => {
    return makeApiCall().then(resp => {
      const { data } = resp;
      const someData = data.filter(filterFunc);
      setData(someData);
    }).catch(err => {
      setError(err.message);
    });
  });
};
```

The `loadingWrapper` allows us to think of our data fetching logic apart from
managing the loading state. Promise chains are tricky enough. If we can remove
a slice of logic, that is a win.

I'm just starting to think about the power of custom React hooks. Let me know
