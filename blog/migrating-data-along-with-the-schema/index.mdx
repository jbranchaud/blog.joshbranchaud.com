It all started with wanting to move a column from one table to another. The
schema changes were straightforward enough. We wanted to keep the data as well,
so that too needed to be migrated. We wrote the migration, deployed the code,
and then found ourselves scratching our heads. Why was our new column empty? In
this post I'll breakdown what happened and how we fixed it. At the end I'll
suggest a couple other approches we could take for writing more robust
migrations in Rails.

### An Example

Let's set up a small example that will help illustrate what happened. We have a
[bookshelf app](https://github.com/jbranchaud/rails-bookshelf-example) that
allows us to track authors and books.

Here is the schema for our authors table:

```sql
> \d authors
                            Table "public.authors"
   Column   |            Type             |             Modifiers
------------+-----------------------------+------------------------------------
 id         | uuid                        | not null default gen_random_uuid()
 name       | character varying           | not null
 genre      | character varying           | not null
 created_at | timestamp without time zone | not null
 updated_at | timestamp without time zone | not null
Indexes:
    "authors_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
Referenced by:
    TABLE "books" CONSTRAINT "fk_rails_53d51ce16a" FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors(id)
```

Here is the schema for our books table:

```sql
> \d books
                                Table "public.books"
      Column      |            Type             |             Modifiers
------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------------------
 id               | uuid                        | not null default gen_random_uuid()
 title            | character varying           | not null
 publication_year | integer                     | not null
 created_at       | timestamp without time zone | not null
 updated_at       | timestamp without time zone | not null
 author_id        | uuid                        |
Indexes:
    "books_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
    "index_books_on_author_id" btree (author_id)
Foreign-key constraints:
    "fk_rails_53d51ce16a" FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors(id)
```

We can see that `authors` and `books` are related to one another (notice the
foreign key constraint on `books`).

We are still coming to understand this bookshelf domain. Along with that we are
still figuring out our data model. When we first created these columns, we
naively put the `genre` column on `authors`. This makes it hard to represent
any authors that have written books across different genres. We'd like to move
the `genre` column onto `books`. This is a small schema change. We'll add a
`genre` column to books (and let's leave the `genre` column on `authors` for
now).

The app is live and already has some data consisting of a number of authors and
books. That data will need to get migrated along with the schema change.

Here is the `up` part of our migration:

```ruby
  # assume GenericAuthor and GenericBook have been defined above
  def up
    add_column :books, :genre, :string

    GenericAuthor.find_each do |author|
      book = GenericBook.find_by(author_id: author.id)

      puts "Moving #{author.genre} from #{author.name} to #{book.title}"

      update_attrs = { genre: author.genre }
      book.update!(update_attrs)
    end

    puts "\n### Genres have supposedly been migrated ###\n\n"

    GenericBook.find_each do |book|
      puts "The genre of #{book.title} is #{book.genre || 'ø'}"
    end
  end
```

Here is what happens when we run this migration against our live database:

```
$ rails db:forward STEP=1
== 20190518214106 MoveGenreFromAuthorsToBooks: migrating ======================
-- add_column(:books, :genre, :string)
   -> 0.0009s
Moving science fiction from Octavia Butler to Fledgling
Moving essay from David Sedaris to Me Talk Pretty One Day
Moving technical from Martin Fowler to Refactoring

### Genres have supposedly been migrated ###

The genre of Refactoring is ø
The genre of Fledgling is ø
The genre of Me Talk Pretty One Day is ø
== 20190518214106 MoveGenreFromAuthorsToBooks: migrated (0.0209s) =============
```

As we can see the migration runs without error, but it has not done what we
intended or expected — the genre data that we attempted to migrate to the books
table is nowhere to be seen, those columns have been left as null. We have
silently lost data, good thing we didn't destroy the original genre column yet.

### Why did this happen?

It has to do with an optimization built into Rails' default settings -- **schema
caching**.

It is expensive for Rails to load and check the current schema from the
database on every database interaction, so it caches a representation of the
schema with all table and column information. This cache is how `ActiveRecord`
knows what attributes a given model supports without making a round-trip to the
databse.

Despite having added the `genre` column to `books` in the first part of our
migration, Rails believes — according to its cache — that there is no `genre`
column on `books`. As a result, when we call `update!` with attributes that
Rails sees as irrelevant to the `books` table, it happily ignores them.

### How can we ensure our migrations do what we expect?

We need to convince Rails that the `books` table does in fact have a `genre`
column. We can do this by asking `Rails` to go grab a fresh list of columns for
the `books` table. There is a method for this
[`reset_column_information`](https://www.notion.so/jbranchaud/Data-Migration-Troubles-61cb4b49b88e4e2680b63254a082b4ef#a3966b545e6340bcaba41b64a1aa6179).
Here is an updated migration:

```ruby
  def up
    add_column :books, :genre, :string

    GenericBook.reset_column_information

    GenericAuthor.find_each do |author|
      book = GenericBook.find_by(author_id: author.id)

      puts "Moving #{author.genre} from #{author.name} to #{book.title}"

      update_attrs = { genre: author.genre }
      book.update!(update_attrs)
    end

    puts "\n### Genres have supposedly been migrated ###\n\n"

    GenericBook.find_each do |book|
      puts "The genre of #{book.title} is #{book.genre || 'ø'}"
    end
  end
```

By placing this call to reset_column_information in between our schema change
and our data changes, we ensure Rails has a valid cache of the column
information for our books table. If we rerun this migration now, we'll see the
output we were expecting:

```
$ rails db:forward STEP=1
== 20190518214106 MoveGenreFromAuthorsToBooks: migrating ======================
-- add_column(:books, :genre, :string)
   -> 0.0013s
Moving science fiction from Octavia Butler to Fledgling
Moving essay from David Sedaris to Me Talk Pretty One Day
Moving technical from Martin Fowler to Refactoring

### Genres have supposedly been migrated ###

The genre of Refactoring is technical
The genre of Fledgling is science fiction
The genre of Me Talk Pretty One Day is essay
== 20190518214106 MoveGenreFromAuthorsToBooks: migrated (0.0318s) =============
```

That's it -- problem solved!

### What else can we do?

While adding a single line to our migration is certainly a minimal and
straightforward solution, it isn't the only option available to us. Without
going into too much detail, I'll suggest a couple other methodologies that
should also help avoid this scenario.

- Migrations written in raw SQL will not suffer from this caching issue because
the SQL queries are run directly against the database instead of relying on
Arel to generate the SQL that will be run against the database. Personally,
this is my preferred approach. It only makes sense for teams where everyone
prefers writing SQL.

- Keep schema and data migrations separate. With this approach, you'd have one
migration make the schema change. You'd then follow it with another migration
to make the data change. I don't have a deep understanding of when Rails
invalidates parts of the schema cache, but my guess is that it would get the
latest changes between migrations.

- Keep data changes out of your migrations. This approach says that if you are
going to keep your dschema and data changes separate, you should keep them
totally separate. With this approach, you might choose to write one-off Rake
tasks or a tool like
[after_party](https://github.com/theSteveMitchell/after_party) to manage data
migrations outside the standard migration process.

All of these are valid approaches -- you'll have to evaluate what is best for
you and your team.
