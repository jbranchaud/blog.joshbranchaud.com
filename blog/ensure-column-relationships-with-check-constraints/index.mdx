I'm always looking for ways to keep data consistent. Or rather, for the
database to ensure that its data is consistent.
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) has a number of tools for this. Great
places to start are consistent use of `not null`s and foreign key constraints.
Sometimes you end up in, for lack of a better word, weird situations that call
for a more creative approach. [Check
constraints](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-check-constraint/)
are a versatile tool. They may be just what you need.

## A Scenario

What if data represented by two columns only made sense when both columns were
set? Otherwise, you wouldn't want either of them set. If you find yourself in
this situation, you can enforce this column relationship with a check
constraint.

Consider this books table:

```sql
                                   Table "public.books"
      Column      |       Type        |                     Modifiers
------------------+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------
 id               | integer           | not null default nextval('books_id_seq'::regclass)
 title            | character varying | not null
 author           | character varying | not null
 publication_year | integer           |
 page_count       | integer           |
Indexes:
    "books_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
```

For books that are still being written, it doesn't make sense to list a
`publication_year` or `page_count`. For that reason, those columns are
nullable. However, once a book is ready for publication, both should be set. It
would be _inconsistent_ for a book record to have a page count and no
publication year. This can be enforced with a check constraint and some clever
type coercion.

## A Solution

```sql
alter table books
  add constraint ensure_year_and_page_count_are_set
  check (
    (
      (publication_year is not null)::integer +
      (page_count is not null)::integer
    ) != 1
  );
```

If `publication_year` is `null`, then the first part of the check will resolve
to `false` which, when coerced to an integer, will be `0`. If it isn't `null`,
then `true` which becomes `1`.

These are then added up. Here is a breakdown of the different possibilities:

```
| year   | count  | sum |
+--------+--------+-----+
| null   | null   | 0   |
| null   | value  | 1   |
| value  | null   | 1   |
| value  | value  | 2   |
```

This brings us to the last part of the check constraint. The sum gets compared
to `1`. As long as the sum doesn't equal `1` we consider the constraint to be
respected. That's because either both values are `null` (not yet set to
anything) or both values have been set. Nothing in between.

```sql
insert into books (title, author) values ('Fledgling', "Octavia Butler");
-- ✅ both publication_year and page_count are null

update books set publication_year = 2005 where id = 1;
-- ❌ new row for relation "books" violates
--    check constraint "ensure_year_and_page_count_are_set"

update books set publication_year = 2005, page_count = 352 where id = 1;
-- ✅ both publication_year and page_count are set
```

## Another Solution

I'll admit this example is a bit contrived. I've seen the core elements of this
example come up in realistic contexts. As developers, we are constantly
balancing competing requirements. If the requirements dictate it, the above may
be a good solution for you. In any case, it is definitely worth know that
check constraints can be used in this way.

If requirements don't dictate, I'd encourage moving toward a solution that
involves `not null`s and foreign key constraints. For instance, if two or more
columns are dependent in the way I described above, they likely belong in their
own table. The domain of the problem is leading you here.

Split those columns out into an appropriately named table, make them
non-nullable, and then slap a foreign key constraint on that relationship. This
is great because if both are `null`, then you don't have a column at all. If
they are set, then you create a record with consistency of the data enforced in
a more direct way; neither of the values can be null and the foreign key will
never be orphaned.
